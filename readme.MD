# Maskotki Dzieciom — Foundation Website

This is the official website of the **Maskotki Dzieciom Foundation**, built using React. The website shares information about our work, people we've helped, and how others can support or request help from our foundation.

## 🧩 Pages Overview

### 1. Home
The homepage contains:
- General information about the foundation
- Our mission and goals
- Presentation of the board members
- Important documents available for download
- A visual timeline (built with a library) showing our activities over the years

### 2. Who We've Helped
This page presents:
- Four schools we have supported — clicking on each displays detailed information along with a custom-built image slider
- A list of individual beneficiaries supported by the foundation

### 3. Support Us
Includes:
- Information on how people can support the foundation
- A list of external links to donation and support options

> **Note:** A **"Wesprzyj nas teraz"** and **"Przelew online"** buttons redirect to the main page of [Przelewy24](https://www.przelewy24.pl/) as we do not host this site on a dedicated domain, which is required to open a full account with them.

### 4. For Those in Need
This section explains:
- How individuals can apply for support from the foundation
- A built-in form with validation, allowing users to submit a request for help
- Submitted data is sent directly to the foundation's official email address

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **React** with **react-router-dom** for client-side routing
- **SCSS Modules** for component-level styling
